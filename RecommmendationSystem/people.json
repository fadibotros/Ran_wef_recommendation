Hua Dan has a particular focus on working with China's rural to urban migrant workers, who work in the manufacturing and service industry, at the heart of China's economic boom. Watson has pioneered the importance of participation in the arts and creative education in a country that has no precedent for anything other than a hierarchical, rote-learning education model, empowered the leadership of female migrants from the countryside to lead and manage the organization, and begun developing a sustainable hybrid non-profit/for-profit business model for arts-based learning methodologies. She is also the Founder of the Scheherazade Initiatives, which seek to replicate the Hua Dan model in other parts of the world and provide leadership training services to companies and institutions globally.

    "profile": "Raised in Silicon Valley, Jefferson received a BA in Molecular Genetics from the College of Creative Studies of the University of California and PhD in Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology at the University of Colorado.  During an NIH Postdoc at the Plant Breeding Institute in Cambridge UK, he pioneered biological Open Source, developed and openly distributed the most widely used enabling biotechnology in plants and agriculture and conducted the world's first biotech crop release (1987).  He became the first Molecular Biologist for United Nations (FAO & IAEA) and founder & CEO of Cambia, a global social enterprise focused on democratizing science- and technology-enabled innovation. From 1989-1994, based largely on his work on microbial metabolism of hormones, Jefferson developed the Hologenome Theory of Evolution.  At Cambia, funded by foundations and governments, and through open, tiered licensing of technology, Jefferson launched the Biological Open Source (BiOS) Initiative, and Patent Lens - the first open, full text global patent search. Jefferson was appointed Professor of Biological Innovation at the Queensland University of Technology in 2009 and seconded to Cambia to develop The Lens - the definitive open, global web platform for innovation cartography, and for surfacing and promoting science and technology capabilities for public benefit.  Jefferson has received awards including being named to the Scientific American List of the 50 Most Influential Technologists, the Inaugural Medalist of Center for Science Policy & Outcomes, and the American Society of Plant Biology Public Service Award.   His interests are in music (mandolin, choro, guitar) juggling, evolution and microbiomes, open innovation systems, intellectual property, farming..",

He is an experienced dealmaker and flexible, goal-driven leader with a track record of managing successful teams in the context of high uncertainty, including turnarounds, highly distressed business/financial situations and pre-/post-merger environments.  \n\nCurrently, Sanjay serves as an advisor to family offices, early stage ventures, and funds in formation. In 2012, Sanjay co-founded Tau Investment Management, a Private Equity Fund focused on disrupting supply-chains globally and served as the Firm’s first Managing Partner. Earlier in 2012, Sanjay was responsible for forming a bidding coalition between two members of Fortune 50 for the Los Angeles Dodgers in one of the most publicized auctions in history. In recent months, Sanjay has been excited to see one of his longstanding entrepreneurial projects in disruptive health care find sponsorship from the legendary Silicon Valley investor and philanthropist, Vinod Khosla. \n\nPreviously, Sanjay served as an Advisor to a member of the top 50 of the Forbes 400 Richest Americans with a net worth in excess of 14 BN USD. His work spanned the management of distressed portfolio companies, strategic acquisitions, strategy development, and business development. Late in 2010, Sanjay participated in the sale of a portfolio company in a public transaction valued at $2.9 Bn USD. \n\nPrior to joining Abraxis, he served as Chief of Staff and Director of Social Enterprise at Intel Corporation, reporting to then General Counsel, Bruce Sewell.  He has also served as the Chief Financial Officer and Director of Strategy for Dossia, a social-enterprise sponsored by Intel, Wal-Mart, Pitney-Bowes, AT&T, Sanofi-Aventis, Cardinal Health, Vanguard Health, Abraxis, Applied Materials, and BP America.  At Dossia, Sanjay worked with the former Chairman and CEO of Intel, Dr. Craig Barrett, as well as the former Chairman and CEO of Pitney Bowes, Michael Critelli. \n\nEarlier in his career, Sanjay was Managing Director and Founder of REALSTRATEGY, a consulting firm based in the US and focused on mid-market financial services firms, social entrepreneurs and health care entities.  He was also a Partner at Geo Health Partners, a Multi-Family Office investment partnership focused on health care investments domestically and internationally. \n\nSanjay was educated at the University of Oxford, Merton College, where he completed his graduated studies in finance and strategy. He studied Philosophy and Bioethics at Georgetown University and also studied Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School, and has received multiple post-graduate certificates from Harvard Business School. In 2010, Sanjay was honored by the World Economic Forum (Davos) as a Young Global Leader, among less than 200 selected annually for the honor from around the globe.",

Currently I focus on advising Chinese state owned companies and banks on their strategic investments into emerging markets, particularly in the energy and infrastructure industries. This commercial and geographical exposure has helped me to understand changing geographical, political and social realities in a very pragmatic way. I am proud of being able to represent my Chinese clients effectively against other sovereign governments in a bilingual capacity, leveraging upon legal expertise to advise on strategic issues, which also requires quick adaptation to new markets, cross cultural communication and building relationships from scratch. I am also passionate about using mainstream finance as a tool for addressing international development issues. Throughout my legal career, I have dedicated substantial amounts of time advising pro bono non-governmental organisations, non-profits and charities on financing and other commercial issues, accompanied by field experience in Africa, South Asia and South America. I think it is essential to use one's professional skills in a way which may benefit society as a whole. In 2014, I advised pro bono the Dolma Development Fund, Nepal's first private equity fund committed to investing in SMEs in Nepal, on regulatory and investment issues, spending 2 weeks on the ground. I am also a founding member of Lean In Beijing, a women's organisations which supports the aspirations of professional and college level women in China through organising events, building communities, mentorship and networking. I launched our Lean In College platform as well as the Lean In mentorship programme for young women in late 2013 – and this platform now has chapters in 18 top-tier universities across China with our mentorship program launched in Beijing and replicated in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen to-date.",

JBA is launching in New Zealand in August, and we plan to quickly scale around the world.\n\nMy community experience doesn’t stop there, previously activating a community around investing in growth stage private equity in New Zealand through equity crowdfunding, and local communities around the world in response to natural disasters. \n\nBy night, I am a jack of all trades. As Curator of the Auckland Global Shapers, I am part of a team who are committed to initiating projects to improve Auckland. As a volunteer, I am a fanatical supporter of various organisations including Live More Awesome (which raises awareness for mental health issues) and Make a Wish (which makes wishes of children with life threatening illnesses). And as a human, I am willing to help wherever I can add value.",

He is interested in understanding the most essential signatures of quantumness in elementary and complex systems, so as to cast light on foundational aspects of quantum theory, while devising novel ways to exploit quantumness operationally for robust applications. He has studied entanglement and quantum correlations in general, in discrete as well as continuous variable multipartite quantum systems (encompassing atoms, light, and interfaces thereof).",

We are currently devoted to understand how the structure of the chromatin is established at the beginning of embryonic development and how it supports totipotency.\nResearch in our group focusses on understanding how early mouse development is regulated by chromatin-mediated changes in gene regulation, that is, by epigenetic information. In particular, we are interested in understanding how the transitions in cell potency and cell fate are regulated by chromatin-mediated processes. \nOur work will also allow new insights in understanding the biology of the pluripotent stem cells, in particular on their origin and development. From a broader perspective, deciphering the basic mechanisms underlying the earliest steps of mammalian development is essential to understand early aspects of embryonic development, human reproduction and stem cell biology.",

In Schuller’s iHEARu project, ground-breaking methodology including novel techniques for multi-task and semi-supervised learning will deliver for the first time intelligent holistic and evolving analysis in real-life condition of universal speaker characteristics which have been considered only in isolation so far. Today's sparseness of annotated realistic speech data will be overcome by large-scale speech and meta-data mining from public sources such as social media, crowd-sourcing for labelling and quality control, and shared semi-automatic annotation.",

He has received several awards, including Premio Sapio Junior per la Ricerca Italiana, the Medal \"Le Scienze in Fisica\" with the \"Medal of the Presidency of the Republic », Award Sapienza Ricerca. He is the author of more than 120 publications in international journals (among which 20 publications on Nature and Science journals) and about 100 invited presentations at national and international conferences. Since 2009, Fabio Sciarrino has obtained fundings for the University of Roma “La Sapienza” as principal investigator for a total amount of more than 3.500.000 euros (approx. 3.100.000 from Europe and 400.000 from Italy). In 2010 he won the project HYTEQ (Hybrid Technologies for Quantum Information Processing) funded by FIRB - Future in Research for young Italian researchers. In 2012 he was awarded an ERC grant Starting Grant-Consolidator 3D-QUEST (www.3dquest.eu), followed by an ERC-Proof of Concept 3D-COUNT in 2015: 3D-Integrated single photon detector. He is the european coordinator of the project Marie Curie Initial Training Networks (ITN): PICQUE (Photonic Integrated Compound Quantum Encoding) started September 2013 (www.picque.eu). He is the european coordinator of the project FET (Future and Emerging Technologies): QUCHIP (Quantum Simulation on a Photonic Chip) . He has the lecture in Quantum Information and Computation at the University \"La Sapienza\". His research has been devoted mainly to the experimental realization of quantum information protocols by exploiting the methods of quantum optics. To achieve his results has required the development of innovative experimental techniques based on non-linear optics, ultra-fast lasers and detection methods, as well as of new theoretical insights. The results of his investigations have advanced the experimental techniques of quantum optics and contributed to understanding some conceptual aspects of the foundations of quantum mechanics and quantum information theory. His current research activity is focused on integrated quantum photonics, specifically on the implementation of boson sampling and quantum simulation.",

As of today we have fulfilled organic food home delivery services to over 500,000 families in 6 metropolitan cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, and Tianjin. In 2012, we set up Organic and Beyond Fund, to promote exchanges and cooperation between China and the other countries. Now, we have done a lot of work on sustainable consumption with WWF and UNEP.\n\nIn organic practice, we found that the enterprises lack of appropriate guidance, the organic sector has a bottle-neck, and organizational leadership needs to be upgraded in China. Fortunately, I have worked for OABC for nearly seven years. I’m familiar with the relevant standards of organic agriculture and processing technology, and I understand the current situation of China's organic industry development better. I have participated in the IFOAM Organic Leadership Course, to learn advanced concepts of organic agriculture and global management experience, to help the development of OABC and China's organic industry.",

Former Postdoctoral Associate, then Research Scientist, Caltech, working on the Laser Interferometric Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). January 2002, joined the Physics faculty, MIT; since 2015, Associate Head, Department of Physics. Has been involved with LIGO since early years in graduate school at MIT and primary research has been in instrument development for interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. Research focuses on interferometric gravitational waves and quantum measurement. The major US effort in this field is LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory), scheduled to come on the air in 2002. The gravitational waves that LIGO and its international counterparts expect to detect are ripples in the space-time fabric caused by the motion of compact, massive astrophysical objects. Since the nature of gravitation is inherently different from electromagnetism, gravitational wave astrophysics has the potential to provide a radically different view of the universe, including direct observation of massive dark matter, large-scale nuclear matter and a test of strong-field gravitation.",

Ms. Perchick is the executive in charge of several initiatives which aim to expand access to leading cancer care, including the expansion of MSK’s overall clinical enterprise as new facilities begin operations, the collaboration with IBM Watson to develop an oncology decision-support tool for physicians anywhere, and the MSK Cancer Alliance which establishes dynamic partnerships with local care providers.\nMs. Perchick has held many different roles since joining MSK in 1976. She combines deep knowledge of hospital operations with a track record of developing innovative models for improving patient care. In 1999, for example, she opened MSK’s first freestanding ambulatory care facility and led the implementation of a fully electronic medical record for the vast majority of MSK’s ambulatory care services.\nIn addition to significant operational responsibilities, Ms. Perchick leads a diverse group of quantitative analysts and design-research professionals within the Office of Strategy and Innovation. The team’s quantitative work, recognized in 2012 with the INFORMS Prize, has enabled MSK to create models for everything from optimal treatment pathways to potential locations for ambulatory care sites.",

Now Staff Scientist, Lawrence Berkeley National Labs, California, US.\n\nMyriad cellular and metabolic processes govern the transformation of energy in living organisms. By understanding the structure of cellular structures engaged in the bioenergetic activities, Karen Davies gains insight into their functions. Davies' lab studies the biogenesis of bioenergetic compartments and how the structure of these specific areas change in response to environmental conditions such as light, temperature, and nutrient availability. Using electron cryo-tomography with sub-tomogram averaging in conjunction with single particle electron cryo-microscopy, Davies aims to determine how the structure and organization of proteins in situ influence cellular structure and function. In particular, she seeks to uncover the role of enzymes in shaping mitochondrial cristae, bioenergetic membranes important in the process of cellular respiration. Besides studying bioenergetic compartment design and assembly, Davies delves deeper into cellular chemical reactions like photosynthesis by studying the role of NADH and NADPH dehydrogenases in carbon fixation.",

Now Director of Plant Systems Biology. Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI), Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, USA.\r\n\r\nSugars are one of the fundamental building blocks of life. Whether glycosylating proteins or lipids, or as complex polysaccharides, they are essential to the health of the cell. However, unlike, DNA and protein, these complex sugar molecules are built without an apparent template. An enormous number of combinations are possible due to the different starting molecules (monosaccharides) and the myriad ways they can be linked together. We know that assembly is carefully controlled by the organism, since serious pathologies can result when this process goes wrong. Yet, we know surprisingly little about how this happens.\r\n\r\nMortimer's research focus is to understand the mechanisms that drive glycan assembly. This includes making the substrates (the nucleotide sugars), transporting them to the correct compartment in the cell, and then synthesizing the macromolecules. Questions about how these processes are regulated, as well as how the completed molecules are exported to the wall are essential if we want to engineer biomass to produce the fuels and materials that we will require in the future.",
